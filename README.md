# Housing-Price-Prediction-using-Regression

This is a regression problem to predict california housing prices.

The dataset contains 20640 entries and 10 variables.

Longitude

Latitude

Housing Median Age

Total Rooms

Total Bedrooms

Population

Households

Median Income

Median House Value

Ocean Proximity

Median House Value is to be predicted in this problem.

I have done this project in two parts. First part contains data analysis and cleaning as explained in EDA and data cleaning.ipynb. Second is training of machine learning models explained in Training Machine Learning Algorithms.ipynb.

1) EDA and Data Cleaning

I have done the exploratory data analysis and done following manipulations on data.

Creating new features

Removing outliers

Transforming skewed features

Checking for multicoliniearity

2) Training machine learning algorithms:

Here, I have trained various machine learning algorithms like

Linear Regression

Ridge Regression

Support Vector Regression

Gradient Boosting Regression

Stacking of various models
